Hi there!

Thank you so much for purchasing the Adventure Music Collection!!
I am so excited to have my music in your games.  Bringing music and emotion to games brings me great joy. I would love to see the game you're working on,
if you don't mind sharing shoot me an email! :)

Also, if you have any questions or concerns please don't hesitate to reach out.
My composer email is: dk.compose@gmail.com

If you are interested in purchasing custom music for a future game (or current one) I have a website where you can get a quick and easy quote for music that will be 
exclusive to your game!  

My website is:

Finally, if you love the music a review and rating would be hugely appreciated.  Don't think the music pack is worth 5 stars?  Email me and let me know how I can improve.

Happy Coding!!!

-Daniel
